# 🔐 SecureTask.API

A secure, production-ready Task Management Web API built with **ASP.NET Core**, **C#**, and **Entity Framework Core**.  
This project is designed as a full-stack backend learning journey covering everything from setup to security, authentication, and deployment — tested using **Postman**.

---

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SecureTask.API.git
cd SecureTask.API
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run


## ✅ SecureTask.API – Learning & Implementation Roadmap

This project is a complete learning journey to build a secure, versioned, and production-ready ASP.NET Core Web API with C# and SQL Server. All tasks are tracked here to simulate a Jira-like backlog.

---

### 📁 Project Sections & Task Tracker

### 📌 Phase 1: Project Setup

* ⬜ Initialize Git repository and create `.gitignore`
* ⬜ Create ASP.NET Core Web API project (`dotnet new webapi`)
* ⬜ Clean up template files & configure folder structure
* ⬜ Setup solution & project naming (`SecureTask.API`)
* ⬜ Add README.md with roadmap

---

### 🔐 Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization

* ⬜ Implement **JWT Authentication**
* ⬜ Create Login & Register endpoints
* ⬜ Add password hashing (e.g., BCrypt)
* ⬜ Protect routes with `[Authorize]`
* ⬜ Add role-based access (Admin/User)
* ⬜ Secure tokens with expiration & refresh support (optional)

---

### 🧱 Phase 3: Core API Functionality (Task Management)

* ⬜ Define Task model and DTOs
* ⬜ Setup EF Core and database context
* ⬜ Configure SQL Server connection string
* ⬜ Apply EF Core migrations
* ⬜ Implement CRUD endpoints:

  * ⬜ Create Task
  * ⬜ Get All Tasks
  * ⬜ Get Task by ID
  * ⬜ Update Task
  * ⬜ Delete Task

---

### 🛡️ Phase 4: Security & Best Practices

* ⬜ Add global exception handling middleware
* ⬜ Add HTTPS redirection
* ⬜ Enable CORS policy
* ⬜ Add rate limiting (using `AspNetCoreRateLimit`)
* ⬜ Configure custom headers for versioning & tracking
* ⬜ Add Swagger with JWT Authorization support
* ⬜ Version API (e.g., `/api/v1/tasks`)

---

### 📦 Phase 5: Testing & Tools

* ⬜ Setup **Postman collection** with environment variables
* ⬜ Add tests for:

  * ⬜ Register/Login
  * ⬜ Authenticated Task CRUD
* ⬜ Setup logging using built-in logging provider (or Serilog)
* ⬜ Add model validations and response shaping

---

### 🐳 Phase 6: Deployment & CI/CD (Optional)

* ⬜ Add Docker support (Dockerfile)
* ⬜ Add GitHub Actions for CI (optional)
* ⬜ Prepare for Azure/AWS deployment

---

### 🗂 Phase 7: Documentation

* ⬜ Finalize README with:

  * Project overview
  * Setup instructions
  * Tech stack
  * How to run
* ⬜ Add code comments and inline documentation
* ⬜ Push repo to GitHub and mark as portfolio-ready
